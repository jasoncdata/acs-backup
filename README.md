# ACS Data Backup
Using the [censusdis](https://github.com/censusdis/censusdis) library, this script downloads and saves CT (state, county, planning region, town) ACS data for user-specified years and table IDs. A full list of table IDs can be downloaded on the [Census Bureau's website](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/technical-documentation/table-shells.html).
Code was thrown together quickly while federal datasets were being taken offline in Feb 2025, but it got the job done.
